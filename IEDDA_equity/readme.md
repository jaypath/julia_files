Background: Increasing evidence suggests that race affects EEG data collection for a variety of reasons, including access to care, hair type, hair style, and other biases.

Hypothesis: Algorithms will be inherently biased because training data lacks representation from certain races. Additionally, in some cases when racially disparate data is available, certain races may be more likely to be excluded if EEG data quality is inherently worse for those groups

Question: Is IEDDA racially biased?

To do:

-[x] assess the racial distribution of IEDDA training set
