Grant and Paper/Abstract Submissions

This repo is for organization of Beacon grant and paper/abstract submissions.

Each major item should be organized into a folder containing a brief overall description, detailed notes, and either the work in progress or a link to the work in progress on MS365 (do not work locally or on google drive please). Detailed location information for all data sources and text needs to be described in a file within each folder labeled data sources as such:
