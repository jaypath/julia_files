Data Analysis To Do
[ ] Characterize per spike performance of IEDDA
  [ ] human mark IEDs in some subsample of AD data
  [ ] Run IEDDA on this subsample, check performance, retrain on this data
  [ ] run IEDDA on held out marked data, check performance
  
[ ] Characterize sleep in this data set

[ ] reduce EEG to mimic spotlite data (probably just 6 channel)
  [ ] compare IEDDA 6 channel to full 10-20 IEDDA to human markings
