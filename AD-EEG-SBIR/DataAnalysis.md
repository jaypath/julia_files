Data Analysis To Do
- [ ] Characterize per spike performance of IEDDA
  - [] human mark IEDs in some subsample of AD data
  [ ] Run IEDDA on this subsample, check performance, retrain on this data
  [ ] run IEDDA on held out marked data, check performance
  
[ ] Characterize per study performance of IEDDA
  [ ] Run IEDDA on across data sets, eval Sn, Sp, PPV, NPV at the study level
  
[ ] Characterize sleep in this data set
  [ ] sleep stage subset of data manually (possibly all the datasets)
  [ ] Sleep staging alg TBD
  [ ] run sleep depth analysis
  [ ] run spindle detection

[ ] reduce EEG to mimic spotlite data (probably just 6 channel)
  [ ] compare IEDDA 6 channel to full 10-20 IEDDA to human markings
  [ ] compare IEDDA 8 channel to full 10-20 IEDDA to human markings
