Data Analysis To Do
- [ ] Characterize per discharge performance of IEDDA [IEDDA = our AI discharge detector]
  - [ ] Ask Platform Team to create AD-EEG-SBIR Project in the Beacon Portal
  - [ ] Identify which recordings
  - [ ] human mark IEDs in some subsample of AD data - create task for this
    -create task
      - Jay suggests Y/N on Spikes with IEDDA on low threshold 
      - Jay to follow up on this
    -assign reviewers
    -follow up
    -estimated time: 2 weeks
  - [ ] Run IEDDA on this subsample, check performance, retrain on this data
  - [ ] run IEDDA on held out marked data, check performance
  - [ ] Run the praxis spike peak/other metrics
  - [ ] TOPOPLOT of spike activity!!!
  
- [ ] reduce EEG to mimic spotlite data (probably just 6 channel)
  - [ ] compare IEDDA 6 channel to full 10-20 IEDDA to human markings
  - [ ] compare IEDDA 8 channel to full 10-20 IEDDA to human markings

- [ ] Characterize per study performance of IEDDA
  - [ ] Run IEDDA on across data sets, eval Sn, Sp, PPV, NPV at the study level
  
- [ ] Characterize sleep in this data set
  - [ ] Adding a bit more PSGs from AD pts, and then have them reviewed via labelers for the sleep analysis part
  - [ ] sleep stage subset of data manually (possibly all the datasets)
  - [ ] Sleep staging alg TBD
  - [ ] run sleep depth analysis
  - [ ] run spindle detection
