Discussion with MD Kerns, Grant Manager

Initial response from Dr. Kerns:

Eligible applicants to the Small Business Programs are SBA-defined (for-profit) small business concerns (see the NIH Small Business Web pages: https://www.sbir.gov/ ). Note: All eligible applicant small businesses must be American-owned & located in America.
 
Phase I SBIR & STTR (R43 & R41) applications/projects are limited to one  to three (at most) specific aims that are focused on the development of a testable prototype (product or compound).  Phase II SBIR & STTR (R44 & R42) applications/projects should propose further product development &, perhaps, some form of between-group comparison to demonstrate a purported benefit/effect.
 
If the applicant small business concern has already developed a prototype product or compound or service then very often the SBIR & STTR Phase I programs are not appropriate. If research & development has already yielded a testable prototype, small business concerns can consider an application to the SBIR-STTR Fast-Track program (which allows for the extant development of a testable prototype) or the SBIR-only Direct-to-Phase-II option.  Both are detailed here: https://seed.nih.gov/small-business-funding/small-business-program-basics/understanding-sbir-sttr#comparing-SBIR-and-STTR.
 
There are fundamental differences between the legacy SBIR & STTR grant mechanisms (for example, for SBIR projects, the P.I. must be primarily employed the applicant small business; the legacy STTR allows the applicant small business to appoint a P.I. who is primarily employed by the research partner).  For the differences, see: https://seed.nih.gov/small-business-funding/small-business-program-basics/understanding-sbir-sttr.
 
As important as the technical (including scientific) expertise is, it is just as important that the applicant SBC has the entrepreneurial, business, & management (including financial management) expertise necessary to succeed (read: bring the product to the marketplace, generate profit, & contribute to the economy).  Historically, the majority of applicant SBIR-STTR SBCs do not have such expertise and/or have not sufficiently planned for and/or striven to obtain it.  SBCs lacking such expertise very often do not succeed (beyond obtaining NIH SBIR-STTR funding).
 
In particular, NIA has been charged with the task of leading the federal government’s R & D effort on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) & AD-related dementias. So NIA has a lot of money to spend on R & D addressing AD/ADRD.  NIA has issued Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) that targets AD/ADRD-focused Small Business R & D:  For the SBIR option: PAS-19-316 (see: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pas-19-316.html); for the STTR option: PAS-19-317 (see: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAS-19-317.html).
 
Please be sure to refer to & closely read PAS-19-316/317, including Part 1. Overview, Related Notices. One of the listed Related Notices, NOT-AG-19-040 (see: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-AG-19-040.html) stipulates increased budget limits for applications to PAS-19-316/317 (Phase I: up to $500K; Phase II: up to $2.5 million).
 
Note: The next application-submission due dates are:  April 5, 2022 & September 5, 2022 (there are three annual submission due dates: January 5th, April 5th, & September 5th).
 
A reminder: The applicant small business must complete the mandatory registrations to be eligible to submit an application, which take 6-8 weeks to complete. See: https://seed.nih.gov/small-business-funding/how-to-apply/before-you-apply/register-company.       
 
Finally, please refer to & closely read the attached PowerPoint slide deck, which provides comprehensive information & guidance about NIA’s Small Business R & D grant programs & the application submission & review processes.

Additional discussion with Dr. Kerns:
On the subject of application receipt, review, & assignment: For a potential SBIR-STTR application to be assigned to NIA (by NIH’s Center for Scientific Review, CSR), the proposed R & D/application must focus on the development of  technology focusing in aging and/or & addressing the needs of older/senior individuals.

CSR bases all assignment determinations on the relevance of the proposed R & D to the R & D mission of each of the 27 institutes or centers (ICs)--& NIA sponsors R & D that explicitly & exclusively addresses aging, aging-related conditions, or conditions that are in fact the explicit product of aging (& not merely coincident with aging).

Neither NIA nor any other IC (or any other NIH program staff, including myself) is allowed any role in CSR’s application receipt, review, & assignment activities (& CSR review of small business applications is organized around the R & D topics addressed in submitted applications—& not by IC). 

Net-net: Application receipt, review, & assignment are under the categorical authority control of CSR.

Regarding IC application assignment: Although it’s not required, Small Business R & D applicants may include the PHS Application Assignment form as part of their electronic application package. Using the PHS Application form allows applicants to request application assignment to one or another IC (including NIA) & to request assignment to one or another review study section.

Here’ s some guidance about using the PHS Application Assignment form, which when you think about it (the guidance) I believe you can discern that it focuses primarily on NIH’s academic research grant applications/programs & review, & the Chartered (Standing) Review Groups (to which the academic research grant applications are assigned.  But it can also be used for applications to the Small Business R & D grant programs: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-e/general/g.600-phs-assignment-request-form.htm.

Note: Application Assignment requests are just that: requests--& they are not binding upon CSR (CSR will take the request into consideration but is not bound by or obligated to enact the requested assignment).

For my part, I suggest (to applicants) that they fill out the part requesting IC (institute/center) assignment & leave the rest blank.  And, if the applicant wishes, the PHS Application Assignment form can be used to request dual assignment (to more than one IC).
